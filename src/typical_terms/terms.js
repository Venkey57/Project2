              typicl is an application based software that uses artificial
              intelligence algorithms to edit, modify and transform your photos.
              The application allows you to (a) upload photos onto application;
              (b) edit and modify uploaded photos. Any processing of photos you
              submit through typicl are governed by our{" "}

            <p>
              From time to time and without prior notice to you, we may change,
              expand, and improve the application. We may also, at any time,
              cease to continue operating part or all of the application or
              selectively disable certain features of the application. Your use
              of the application does not entitle you to the continued provision
              or availability of the application. Any modification or
              elimination of typicl or any particular features will be done at
              our sole discretion.

              <b> TL;DR:</b> generally, you should be at least 13 years old or,
              if you are from the EEA or UK, 16 years old to use typicl.
              However, if you want to generate Avatars, this requires you to be
              at least of the age of legal majority (it means you must be both:
              at least 18 years of age; and of the age of majority under the
              laws of your jurisdiction). We introduce such an age limitation
              for Avatars because the AI is unpredictable and, though we do our
              best to configure the safety settings, we do not want to harm any
              minors with any unexpected content.

              total liability arising out of or in connection with these Terms
              or from the Use of or inability to Use typicl exceed the amounts
              you have paid to Use typicl or ten ($10) U.S. dollars, if you have
              not had any payment obligations to the Company, as applicable. The
              exclusion and limitations of damages set forth above are
              fundamental elements of the basis of the bargain between the

              The limitations set forth in this Section will not limit or

              law. Additionally, some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion

              limitations or exclusions may not apply to you.

              Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1, et seq. (“<b>FAA</b>”), to the maximum extent

              dispute and to grant any remedy that would otherwise be available
              in court; provided, however, that the arbitrator does not have the

              or representative proceeding or preside over any proceeding
